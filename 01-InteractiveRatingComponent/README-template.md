### What I learned

This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge, so I used it to get used to the format. I matched it as closely as I could as the screenshots rendered the text slightly different compared with my system (Windows 10, Chrome).

I added a couple of extra little pieces such as an error message if the user tries to click the submit button without selecting a rating. Overall it was a great challenge to begin with and I'm happy with the outcome.

I added just a couple of basic media queries as they weren't really needed, really just adjusting the padding on the rating card, and the spacing on the rating selector buttons.
