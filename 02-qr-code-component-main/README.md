## My process

- This was the first time I've really dug into using TailWind CSS for a quick project. I haven't quite decided if I like it but I do see the benefit of deployment when using something like Parcel but the code isn't the tidiest thing to look at. I'll use it on some more projects and add it as another feather in the cap, even if I don't end up using it again.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - For packaging, probably not needed.

### What I learned

With this being my first proper run with Tailwind, it was a little slow going just because of the need to reference constantly but I can sort of see the benefit of it's use, certainly for someone who's fresh to using CSS and needs a helping hand, or when working in a team to keep a more cohesive style guide.

### Continued development

I'll definitely give Tailwind CSS another shot and see how well it works in a larger project.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Definitely helpful for referencing what classes should be used.
